# Momentum for Automobility: Unofficial Port

This is an unofficial Fabric port of [Momentum for Automobility](https://modrinth.com/mod/momentum-for-automobility) by milkucha for newer Minecraft versions. It requires [Automobility: Unofficial Port](https://modrinth.com/mod/automobility-unofficial-port); it does not include the base vehicle mod.

Momentum adjusts Automobility's acceleration, coasting, braking, steering, drift behavior, and camera response. It also adds a compact speed HUD and cruise control.

## Features

- Smoother acceleration, coasting, and braking
- Separate brake and handbrake/drift inputs
- Multiple drift profiles and drift skid sounds
- Camera response for steering, braking, reversing, and drifting
- Compact speed HUD with a cruise-control indicator and target speed
- Cruise control on the `C` key while driving
- Controlify support through Automobility's controller bindings
- Dedicated multiplayer synchronization for brake, drift, and gameplay configuration

Cruise control disengages when braking, drifting, reversing, leaving the driver seat, or hitting a wall or vehicle hard enough to count as an impact.

## Supported Versions

Matching Fabric builds are available for Minecraft Java 26.1.x and 26.2. Install the Momentum file that matches both your Minecraft version and the Automobility port file.

## Requirements

- Fabric Loader and Fabric API
- [Automobility: Unofficial Port](https://modrinth.com/mod/automobility-unofficial-port) on both the client and server
- Java 25 or newer

Momentum is required on both the client and server in multiplayer. Movement, steering, drift, and cruise settings are controlled by the server; HUD, camera, and key preferences remain local to each client.

## Optional

- YetAnotherConfigLib (YACL) enables the in-game options screen.
- Mod Menu exposes the Momentum options button when YACL is also installed.

## Compatibility

The port has been tested in singleplayer and on a multiplayer Fabric 26.1.2 server with a large mod set, including common performance, world-generation, mapping, voice-chat, controller, rendering, shader, and quality-of-life mods. This does not guarantee compatibility with every modpack. Include logs and a full mod list when reporting an issue.
