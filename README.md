# Automobility - Unofficial 26.1.2 Port

This repository is an unofficial Fabric port/fork of [Automobility](https://modrinth.com/mod/automobility) by [FoundationGames](https://github.com/FoundationGames/Automobility) for Minecraft Java 26.1.2. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by FoundationGames unless stated otherwise by the upstream maintainers.

Automobility adds customizable and functional vehicles, automobile parts, attachments, road-building blocks, driving controls, sounds, and resource/data-pack vehicle support.

**Automobility is currently in BETA.** This port should also be treated as beta until it has wider public testing.

## Available for Fabric
- Targets Minecraft Java **26.1.2**
- Requires **[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)**
- Requires Fabric Loader **0.19.2 or newer**
- Requires Java **25 or newer**
- Optional Fabric controller support through **[Controlify](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlify)**

This port currently publishes a Fabric build only. The upstream project is maintained separately; use this fork's issue tracker for 26.1.2 port bugs once a public source repository is available.

## Port Status
- Vehicle driving, drifting, horn, sounds, speed HUD, boost FOV, and drift smoke are ported.
- Automobile Assembler, Auto Mechanic Table, recipes, parts, attachments, and road blocks are ported.
- OBJ-based vehicle/resource-pack rendering and addon data are ported.
- Multiplayer vehicle visual displacement is synced so remote cars keep correct height and tilt when changing elevation.

### Supports Data Packs and Resource Packs
- Add your own custom vehicle types with data packs and resource packs! 
- Here is an [example](https://github.com/FoundationGames/City-Vehicles-Example-Addon) that you can use as a template.

## Getting Started
- **Recipes:** Crafting table recipes can be viewed using [**EMI**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/emi) or [**JEI**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei). Automobile part recipes are viewed in the Auto Mechanic Table's GUI.
- **Automobile Parts:** Craft an Auto Mechanic Table. Use the GUI to craft the frame, engine, and wheels for your automobile. You can optionally craft an attachment.
- **Building your Automobile:** Craft an Automobile Assembler, as well as a Crowbar. Place parts on the assembler until the vehicle is complete. Use a crowbar to destroy the vehicle.
- **Enhancing your Automobile:** Use your Auto Mechanic Table to craft attachments, which can be placed on your Automobile to add exciting functionality or utility.
- **Building:** You can use Slopes, Dash Panels, Off-Road tiles and more to build roads, racetracks, or obstacle courses.
