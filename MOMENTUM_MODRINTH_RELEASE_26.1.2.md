## Version Changelog

```markdown
Patch release for the unofficial Minecraft Java 26.1.x Fabric port of Momentum for Automobility.

### Added
- Added working optional Mod Menu integration when YACL is installed.
- Added backward-compatible server-to-client gameplay configuration sync so vehicle physics use the server's settings in multiplayer.
- Added remote brake and drift input sync for automobiles tracked by other clients.
- Added Controlify brake and drift input through Automobility's existing controller bindings.

### Fixed
- Restricted client input to the automobile driven by the local player instead of applying static brake or drift state to every loaded automobile.
- Ignored raw brake and drift keys while a chat, menu, or other screen is open.
- Made automatic drift direction deterministic across the client and server and used automobile-specific ground detection on slopes.
- Recovered safely from malformed configuration files, validated unsafe numeric values, and wrote configuration updates atomically.
- Reset key-state synchronization between multiplayer connections and stopped rendering a filled speed bar at zero speed.

### Changed
- Moved the default speed HUD position to the upper-right corner for new configurations.
- Kept HUD, camera, and key preferences client-side while treating movement, steering, drift, and cruise behavior as server-authoritative in multiplayer.
